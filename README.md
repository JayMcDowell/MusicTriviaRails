<h1>A Ruby on Rails Music Trivia Quiz</h1>
<h1>by Jay McDowell</h1>

<h2>Goals:</h2>

<h3>To create a music trivia quiz that covers multiple timespans as well as multiple difficulty levels.
The project will be presented on June 28th.</h3>

<h2>What I learned:</h2>

<h3>The power of the database is immense.<h3>
<h3>I used Zurb Foundation as a styling framework.</h3>

<h2>Challenges:</h2>
<h3>Adapting this project from the command line app was the main challenge.  </h3>
<h3>Learning Zurb Foundation was a bit of a curveball as I had used bootstrap for every previous project.</h3>

<h3>Features:</h3>


<h4>1. User should be able to identify themselves and have a running total of their accomplishments.</h4>
<h4>2. User should be able to view score.</h4>
<h4>3. Users can choose the quiz genre they want to take.</h4>
<h4>4. Users can choose the level of difficulty of a quiz.</h4>
<h4>5. Users will be praised/shamed based on their performance.</h4>

<h3>Usage:</h3>



<h4>This is a standard rails web app.  To run the tests, use 'rake'.  To run the app, use 'localhost:3000'.</h4>

<h3>Project  State:</h3>


<h4>The magic is happening!</h4>

<h3>Changelog:</h3>
